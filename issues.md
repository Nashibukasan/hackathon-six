# Implementation Issues Log

This file tracks any issues encountered during the implementation process.

## Issues Log

### Issue #1: ESLint Configuration Warnings
**Status**: Non-blocking, but should be addressed
**Description**: ESLint configuration shows warnings about invalid options (useEslintrc, extensions) in the build output
**Impact**: Build succeeds but with warnings
**Recommendation**: Update ESLint configuration to use the new flat config format properly

### Issue #2: Next.js Viewport Metadata Warnings
**Status**: Non-blocking, but should be addressed for best practices
**Description**: Multiple pages show warnings about unsupported metadata viewport configuration. Next.js 15+ requires viewport to be moved to a separate viewport export instead of being in metadata.
**Impact**: Build succeeds but with warnings
**Affected Files**: 
- src/app/layout.tsx
- src/app/onboarding/page.tsx
- src/app/page.tsx
- src/app/profile/page.tsx
- src/app/register/page.tsx
- src/app/about/page.tsx
- src/app/terms/page.tsx
- src/app/privacy/page.tsx
**Recommendation**: Move viewport configuration to separate viewport export in each page

### Issue #3: API Route User Management
**Status**: Functional but needs improvement
**Description**: The consent API route creates temporary user IDs and has simplified user creation logic that may not handle all edge cases properly
**Impact**: Works for demo purposes but not production-ready
**Recommendation**: Implement proper user session management and improve user creation/update logic
